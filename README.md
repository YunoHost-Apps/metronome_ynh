## Overview

Metronome is a light-weight [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) instant-messaging server written in Lua and based on Prosody. It's aimed to provide advanced features while maintaining a modest resource usage. More details on [the official website](https://archon.im/metronome-im/).

To use Metronome / XMPP, you will also need a client, for example:

- [Movim](https://movim.eu) - Web - available as a YunoHost app
- [ConverseJS](https://conversejs.org) - Web - available as a YunoHost app
- [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) - Linux, Windows
- [Dino](https://dino.im) - Linux
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/fr/) - Linux, Windows, MacOS
- [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) - Android

You will be able to connect using `your_yunohost_username@domain.tld` + your password (i.e. your credentials are the same as for email, but for instant messaging)
